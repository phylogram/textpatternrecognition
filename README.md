# It is just a riddle

Explanation is found in the jupypter notebook: ./Usage Presentation.ipynb or if you do not want to use jupyter see Usage_Presentation.py

## Installation

Use python 3.6 or venv. Nothing more needed for the core, only the usage examples are in a jupyter notebook, but also available as User_Presentation.py


## TO DO:

- Add any kind of logging / remember functionality. For example store positions of found occurrences in memory for â€¦
- adding a replacement functionality,
- adding alternative search functions instead of regex. RegEx may perform badly in some cases, see: https://flashtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  
  - which is not build in the parent class for inheriting. That could cause some troubles later.
